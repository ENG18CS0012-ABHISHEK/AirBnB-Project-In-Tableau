# Airbnb Data Analysis and Visualization
In this project, I used an Airbnb dataset extracted from Kaggle to explore and visualize key insights. The dataset was divided into two parts: Airbnb Project.part1 and Airbnb Project.part2 to upload on GitHub because of the file size >25MB, where I performed data cleaning operations to handle missing values and inconsistencies. After cleaning, I visualized the data using Tableau, providing interactive dashboards that highlight various aspects of Airbnb listings.

The dataset includes details on listing URLs, host information, location coordinates, pricing, amenities, availability, and guest reviews. Key insights from the visualization include pricing trends, location-based popularity, host responsiveness, and review scores for different properties.

# Technologies used:

Data Cleaning: Performed in MsExcel
Visualization: Tableau
Dataset: Airbnb listings dataset from Kaggle
